# Snowball Rush — README

## Overview
**Snowball Rush** is a mobile endless runner game concept where the player controls a growing snowball rolling through various environments.  
As the snowball grows, it becomes harder to maneuver — but also grants higher score multipliers and wider coin collection.  
Players must constantly balance **risk and reward** by deciding when to stay large and when to shrink to avoid obstacles.

This project is currently in the **design and prototyping stage** and includes the Game Design Document (GDD), conceptual mechanics, and gameplay descriptions.
